        <h4><em>Web Developer</em></h4>
        <p>Hi there, my name is Adam, and this website marks the begining of my web
          development journey. I enjoy creative projects, design and ♥️traveling. I
          completed my computer science degree in 2013.
          <!--however due to feeling like I
        wasn't as good as my peers, I didn't apply for any jobs and fell into a
        career that from the offset looked interesting and potentially fulfiling,
        but soon became the opposite. This was because I lacked direction and clarity
        in what I truly wanted to do, and thus took on temp role after temp role.

        Saying that, my life outside of work since has been incredibly fulfiling. So
        I don't have too many complaints!-->
        </p>
        <p>
          <!--Since graduating, I've still had an interest in technology, but it was a
        video game called Steins Gate Zero that inspired me to give software
        development another chance. My goal is to build a version of the amadeus app
        that is in the game. I can see this has already been done on github. But I
        want to build it myself and understand exactly what each line of code does.
        Learning HTML, CSS and Javascript should help me create the app, but we
        shall see what happens!-->
